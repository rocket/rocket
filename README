GNU Rocket
==========
GNU Rocket is an intuitive new way of... bah, whatever. It's a sync-tracker,
a tool for synchronizing music and visuals in demoscene productions. It
consists of a GUI editor that runs on Microsoft Windows, and an ANSI C
library that can either communicate with the editor over a network socket,
or play back an exported data-set.

Compile Editor
--------------
GNU Rocket compiles using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Open editor.sln and
select "Build" -> "Build Solution" from the menu to build the editor.

Compile Example
---------------
GNU Rocket contains an example client called example_bass. This is a simple
Direct3D 9.0 and BASS audio library application, that demonstrates how to
use the GNU Rocket API.

Before compiling the example, you need to make sure you have a recent
Microsoft DirectX and BASS SDKs. These can be downloaded from the following
web-sites:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/
http://www.un4seen.com/

Once the prerequisites are installed, the example can be compiled much like
the editor; by opening examples.sln and selecting "Build" -> "Build Solution"
from the menu.

Using the editor
----------------
The GNU Rocket editor is laid out like a music-tracker; tracks (or columns)
and rows. Each track represents a separate "variable" in the demo, over the
entire time-domain of the demo. Each row represents a specific point in time.
Each row consists of a set of key-frames, which are interpolated over time
according to their interpolation modes.

Keyboard shortcuts
-------------------
Some of the GNU Rocket editor's features are available through the menu and
some keyboard shortcut. Here's a list of the supported keyboard shortcuts:

Enter                     Enter key-frame value
Del                       Delete key-frame
i                         Enumerate interpolation mode
Space                     Pause/Resume demo
