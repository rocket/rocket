jsRocket
========
Lets you use Rocket with your JavaScript / Browser demo.

js?

You work in two modes:

**edit mode**
- - - - - - -
Rocket takes control over your demo, and you're able to set various values, interpolate between them - and even move them around.
For how to use <a href="https://github.com/rocket/rocket/">Rocket</a> check their <a href="https://github.com/rocket/rocket/blob/main/README.md">description</a>

```js
//This is the API you'll use
var syncDevice = new JSRocket.SyncDevice(),

    //Beats per minute of your demo tune
    BPM = 170,

    //The resolution between two beats, four is usually fine,- eight adds a bit more finer control
    ROWS_PER_BEAT = 8,

    //we calculate this now, so we can translate between rows and seconds later on
    ROW_RATE = BPM / 60 * ROWS_PER_BEAT,

    //your variable that needs tuning in Rocket
    awesomeness,

    //the current row we're on
    row;

//syncDevice.setConfig({socketURL:"ws://lolcathost:1338"});

//initialize the connection, default URL is ws://localhost:1338/

syncDevice.init();

//-- set up all the things --
//this is also triggered when the Rocket XML is done, so make sure your ogg is ready
syncDevice.on('ready', onSyncReady);
//whenever you change the row, a value or interpolation mode this will get called
syncDevice.on('update', onSyncUpdate);
//[Spacebar] in Rocket calls one of those
syncDevice.on('play', onPlay);
syncDevice.on('pause', onPause);

function onSyncReady(){
  //jsRocket is done getting all the info you already have in Rocket, or is done parsing the .rocket file

  //this either adds a track to Rocket, or gets it for you
  awesomeness = syncDevice.getTrack('AmountOfAwesome');
}

function onSyncUpdate(newRow){
  //row is only given if you navigate, or change a value on the row in Rocket
  //on interpolation change (hit [i]) no row value is sent, as the current there is the upper row of your block
  if(!isNaN(row)){
    row = newRow;
  }

  //update your view
  render(row);
}

function onPlay(){
  //you could also set tune.currentTime here
  console.log("[onPlay] time in seconds", row / ROW_RATE);
}

function onPause(){
  //pause your tune
  console.log("[onPause] time in seconds", row / ROW_RATE);
}

function render(row){
  //change your index of an array, rotation or amount of awesomeness here
  console.log("[render] amount of awesome is now", awesomeness.getValue(row));
}
```
Looks like a fuckton of code, but imagine what hassle you're save tweening your way around with jQuery (which also adds >30kb), sans sockets jsRocket is under 5kb additional to your sync rocket file.
Jump back and forward in the demo, fine tune all the things, or just hand it to somebody who does all the graphics :3

**demo mode**
- - - - - - -
So, you're done with syncing, saved the rocket file and ready to win the compo.

```js
//instead of connecting to the socket, you specify the rocket file (getConfig() works btw)
//if you get "XMLHttpRequest cannot load.." then you're either not working on localhost, or are missing --allow-file-access-from-files as parameter for Chrome
syncDevice.setConfig({rocketXML:"cube.rocket"});

//you're about to demo! Make sure that pants are dropped.
syncDevice.init("demo");
```

jsRocket will now parse the XML, and call //onSyncReady//.
There you either start the demo by playing your tune, or you load the ogg there.

Good luck with the compo :)

If you need a bit more space you can delete, or disable, the following functions:
```js
onSyncUpdate
onPlay
onPause
```

Additional Notes
----------------

```js
//if you need to nuke/nerf/remove the listeners on the callback functions do this:
syncDevice.on('_HANDLER_', function(){});
```

```js
//if Rocket spasms out when you move swiftly through the rows, and limbos between some rows
function render() {
    if(tune.paused === false){
        //only update the row in Rocket when the demo is playing
        _row = tune.currentTime * ROW_RATE;
        _syncDevice.update(_row);
    }
    
    //actual render code
}
```

Has WebSocket support now, thanks kusma <3, no need for Websockify anymore.
